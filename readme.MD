# Marionette Simulator

Using a mobile device with motion and rotation sensors you can control a virtual marionette running on a browser.

## Installation

Though I plan to improve the packaging, for the time being you must have bower and requirejs installed globally.

```
npm i -g requirejs bower
```

Once that's done:

```
npm i
./build
npm start
```

## Using it

Also needs improvement but for now the server is running on port 80 so just navigate with your browser to `http://(server's IP address)` and with your phone to `http://(server's IP address)/phone.html`

Now just move your phone!
